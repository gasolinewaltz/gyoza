Files in this project so far:

amen.wav - The classic Amen break, as re-recorded for freesound.org here:
http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=82508

resampler.c - resamples a .wav file to the desired length (in this case, 24576 bytes)
and writes it out as a C header file for avr-gcc

build.sh - crappy build script, really needs to be replaced with waf
